        {
            "question": "How can I tell if my rug is truly hand-knotted?",
            "answer": "Hand-knotted rugs typically show slight irregularities in pattern when viewed from the back, with visible individual knots. The fringe is an integral part of the foundation, not sewn on. You can also feel the density and weight, as hand-knotted rugs are generally heavier and more flexible than machine-made alternatives. We're happy to provide an assessment to confirm your rug's construction."
        },
        {
            "question": "How often should I clean my hand-knotted rug?",
            "answer": "For most hand-knotted rugs in residential settings, professional cleaning every 2-4 years is recommended. However, this varies based on traffic, exposure to soiling, and environmental conditions. Regular vacuuming (without the beater bar) and immediate attention to spills can extend the time between professional cleanings."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why does hand-knotted rug cleaning cost more than regular rug cleaning?",
            "answer": "Hand-knotted rug cleaning requires specialized expertise, more time-intensive processes, and often involves rare or delicate materials. Our technicians must clean with precision to preserve intricate patterns and structural integrity. The process typically takes longer and requires specialized cleaning agents suitable for high-value rugs, which contributes to the higher cost."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you repair damaged areas in my hand-knotted rug?",
            "answer": "Yes, we offer expert repair services specifically for hand-knotted rugs. Our skilled artisans can reweave damaged areas, reconstruct fringes, rebuild edges, and repair foundation issues. We match materials and techniques to the original construction methods, ensuring repairs blend seamlessly with the existing structure."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will cleaning fade the colors in my hand-knotted rug?",
            "answer": "Our specialized cleaning process for hand-knotted rugs is designed to preserve colors while achieving thorough cleaning. We first test dye stability and then select appropriate cleaning methods and solutions. For rugs with sensitive dyes, we use specialized techniques that minimize any risk of color migration or fading."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much does it cost to clean a hand-knotted rug?",
            "answer": "Our standard pricing for hand-knotted rugs is £20-30 per square meter with a minimum charge of £70. Due to the specialized care required, hand-knotted rugs typically fall at the higher end of this range. All prices include collection, professional cleaning, and delivery. After initial inspection, we provide a detailed quotation as additional treatments may be needed based on the rug's specific condition and materials."
