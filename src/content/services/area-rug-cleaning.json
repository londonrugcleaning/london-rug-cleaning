            "question": "What's the difference between cleaning area rugs and wall-to-wall carpet?",
            "answer": "Area rug cleaning is much more specialized than carpet cleaning. Area rugs often have delicate fringes, backing materials, and construction that requires handling by specialists. We clean area rugs in our dedicated facility with controlled conditions, unlike on-site carpet cleaning. Our process includes more thorough dust removal, immersion washing when appropriate, and proper drying techniques."

For example, a small 1m² rug would cost £70, while a large 4m² rug would range from £80-£120. All prices include collection, professional cleaning, and delivery. Additional charges may apply for stubborn stains, heavy soiling, pet odors, or extensive damage requiring special treatments."
