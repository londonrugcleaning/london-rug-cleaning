# A Guide to Persian Rug History & Care

Persian rugs are more than just floor coverings; they are woven history, art, and culture. For centuries, these masterpieces have been prized for their intricate designs, exceptional craftsmanship, and durability. Owning a Persian rug is like owning a piece of history, and it entails a responsibility to preserve it.

## A Brief History

The art of carpet weaving in Persia (modern-day Iran) dates back over 2,500 years. From the simpler nomadic weaves to the sophisticated floral patterns of the Safavid court workshops, each rug tells a story.
-   **City Rugs:** Woven in workshops in cities like Tabriz, Isfahan, and Nain. Known for high knot counts and elaborate curvilinear designs.
-   **Tribal Rugs:** Woven by nomadic groups. Characterized by geometric patterns and bold colors, often woven from memory.

## Preserving Your Masterpiece

Antique and high-quality Persian rugs require a delicate touch.

### 1. Avoid Direct Sunlight
UV rays are the enemy of natural dyes. Prolonged exposure can fade the vibrant reds and blues that define Persian rugs. Rotate your rug every 6 months to ensure even wear and fading.

### 2. Gentle Vacuuming
Never use a vacuum with a beater bar (rotating brush) on a Persian rug, especially on the fringes. The aggressive action can tear the knots and shred the fringe. Use the suction-only attachment.

### 3. Immediate Spill Response
Blot—never rub—spills immediately. See our guide on spot cleaning for more details, but always act fast to prevent permanent staining.

### 4. Professional Hand Washing
Persian rugs should strictly be **hand-washed**. Machine washing or harsh chemical cleaning can ruin the foundation and cause dyes to run.
At London Rug Cleaning, we use traditional immersion washing techniques. We gently submerge the rug, use soft specialized brushes, and ensure a controlled drying process that preserves the rug's shape and structure.

## The Value of Care

A well-maintained Persian rug can appreciate in value over time. By investing in professional care, you are protecting not just a decor item, but a financial and historical asset.
