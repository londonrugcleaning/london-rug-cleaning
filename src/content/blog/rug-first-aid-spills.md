# Rug First Aid: What to Do When Spills Happen

It happens in slow motion: the glass of wine slips, the coffee cup tips over, or the pet has an accident. Panic sets in. But what you do in the first few minutes can make the difference between a temporary spot and a permanent stain.

## The Golden Rule: BLOT, DON'T RUB

**Never scrub a stain.** Scrubbing damages the fibers, causing them to fray (a condition called "blooming"), and pushes the spill deeper into the rug pile.

## Immediate Steps for Common Spills

### 1. Liquids (Wine, Coffee, Juice, Soda)
1.  **Blot:** Immediately grab a clean, white cloth or paper towel. Press down firmly to absorb as much liquid as possible. Keep changing the cloth until no more color transfers.
2.  **Dilute (Cautiously):** Dampen a clean cloth with cool water and dab the area. Do not soak the rug.
3.  **Blot Again:** Use a dry cloth to absorb the water.

### 2. Pet Accidents
1.  **Remove Solids:** Lift away any solid waste carefully.
2.  **Blot Urine:** Press down firmly with paper towels to absorb moisture.
3.  **Neutralize:** Pet urine is acidic and can permanently damage dyes. A mixture of white vinegar and water (1:4 ratio) can help neutralize the area, but **test on a hidden corner first**.
4.  **Call a Pro:** Pet urine crystals linger even after drying and can cause odors in humid weather. Professional enzymatic cleaning is usually required.

### 3. Oil/Grease
1.  **Absorb:** Sprinkle baking soda or cornstarch on the spot to absorb the oil. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **Vacuum:** Gently vacuum up the powder.
3.  **Solvent:** A small amount of dry cleaning solvent (applied to a cloth, not the rug) may be needed.

## What NOT to Use
-   **Hot Water:** Can set protein stains (blood, milk) and cause shrinkage.
-   **Bleach/Ammonia:** Will destroy wool fibers and strip color.
-   **Generic Carpet Cleaners:** Often too harsh for area rugs.
