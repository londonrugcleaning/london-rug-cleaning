                question: "How often should I have my wool rug professionally cleaned?",
                answer: "We recommend professional cleaning for wool rugs every 2-3 years for rugs in normal household use. However, rugs in high-traffic areas or homes with children, pets, or allergy sufferers may benefit from more frequent cleaning, perhaps annually. Regular vacuuming between professional cleanings is important to prevent soil buildup."
            },
            {
                question: "Why can't I clean my wool rug myself?",
                answer: "Wool rugs can be permanently damaged by incorrect cleaning methods including excessive moisture, improper agitation, high alkalinity, or high temperatures. Common issues from DIY cleaning include shrinkage, color bleeding, browning, distortion, and fiber damage. Our professional process manages these risks while ensuring deep cleaning."
            },
            {
                question: "Will cleaning remove the lanolin from my wool rug?",
                answer: "Our specialized wool cleaning process preserves as much of wool's natural lanolin as possible. This natural oil gives wool its characteristic softness and soil resistance. While some lanolin is inevitably removed during any cleaning process, our gentle methods and wool-safe solutions minimize this loss while still achieving thorough cleaning."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you handle the fringes on my wool rug?",
                answer: "Fringes (usually made of cotton) are cleaned separately from the wool portion of the rug using appropriate cleaning agents and techniques. We take extra care to prevent tangling, yellowing, or weakening of the fringe fibers. After cleaning, fringes are carefully combed and straightened during the drying process."
            },
            {
                question: "Do you offer moth prevention for wool rugs?",
                answer: "Yes, we offer optional moth prevention treatments that can be applied after cleaning. These safe, odorless treatments deter moths from laying eggs in your wool rug, helping prevent future damage. We also provide advice on home care practices that minimize moth risk, such as regular vacuuming and periodic rotation."

Wool rugs typically fall in the middle to upper part of this range depending on their construction and condition. All prices include collection, professional cleaning, and delivery. After initial inspection, we provide a detailed quotation as additional treatments may be needed based on your rug's specific condition."

The fringe is an integral part of the foundation, not sewn on. You can also feel the density and weight, as hand-knotted rugs are generally heavier and more flexible than machine-made alternatives. We're happy to provide an assessment to confirm your rug's construction."

                question: "How often should I clean my hand-knotted rug?",
                answer: "For most hand-knotted rugs in residential settings, professional cleaning every 2-4 years is recommended. However, this varies based on traffic, exposure to soiling, and environmental conditions. Regular vacuuming (without the beater bar) and immediate attention to spills can extend the time between professional cleanings."

                question: "Why does hand-knotted rug cleaning cost more than regular rug cleaning?",
                answer: "Hand-knotted rug cleaning requires specialized expertise, more time-intensive processes, and often involves rare or delicate materials. Our technicians must clean with precision to preserve intricate patterns and structural integrity. The process typically takes longer and requires specialized cleaning agents suitable for high-value rugs, which contributes to the higher cost."

We first test dye stability and then select appropriate cleaning methods and solutions. For rugs with sensitive dyes, we use specialized techniques that minimize any risk of color migration or fading."

We then carefully test all solutions on an inconspicuous area, and use only pH-balanced, fiber-appropriate treatments. For antique or delicate rugs, we employ specialized gentle methods that protect the rug's integrity while still achieving impressive stain removal."

                question: "How do you handle pet stains and odors?",
                answer: "Pet stains require a multi-faceted approach. We begin with enzyme treatments that break down the proteins in urine and other pet accidents. This is followed by specialized cleaning and neutralizing processes. For persistent odors, we employ additional deodorizing treatments that penetrate to the foundation of the rug. In severe cases, we may recommend our deep-saturation cleaning method which thoroughly addresses both the stain and odor."

We also address more challenging problems like dye bleeding, water damage, rust, and mold/mildew stains.

We use cleaning agents and techniques specifically designed for manufactured fibers, which often can tolerate more aggressive cleaning methods.

We use enzymatic cleaners that break down organic matter in pet accidents, followed by specialized deodorizers. One advantage of synthetic fibers is that they typically don't absorb odors as deeply as natural fibers, making complete odor removal more achievable."
